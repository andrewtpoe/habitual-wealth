# Habitual Wealth

I am passionate about pursuing excellence in my finances with Biblical principles. The Habitual Wealth web application is an extension of my desire to help you win with your finances as well.

## Project vision:

My mission is to provide a free budgeting tool that promotes prosperity based on Biblical values and principles.

This project will become a responsive single page application backed by a Rails API and rendered in React. Our humble beginning starts with the budgeting spreadsheet that my family uses for our own finances. [Here is a raw template of that budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JcfALRq4fZpRa92dRHcVvf24uW0dJ8jxEFhsZY6itr4/edit?usp=sharing).

Additionally, this project will be accompanied by the Habitual Wealth Blog, where I will share my own personal thoughts on Biblical personal finance.
