# Habitual Wealth

I am passionate about pursuing excellence in my finances with Biblical principles. The Habitual Wealth web application is an extension of my desire to help you win with your finances as well.

## Primary Tech Stack:

- Ruby 2.2.2
- Rails 4.2.3
- Postgres
- React
- Redux

## Project vision:

My mission is to provide a free budgeting tool that promotes prosperity based on Biblical values and principles.

This project will become a responsive single page application backed by a Rails API and rendered in React. Our humble beginning starts with the budgeting spreadsheet that my family uses for our own finances (link to generic copy coming soon).

Additionally, this project will be accompanied by the Habitual Wealth Blog, where I will share my own personal thoughts on Biblical personal finance.
