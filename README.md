# Habitual Wealth

The Habitual Wealth web application is designed to help everyone passionate about pursuing excellence in their finances through Biblical principles.

## Project vision:

This project's mission is to provide a free, open source budgeting tool that promotes prosperity based on Biblical values and principles.

Habitual Wealth is planned as a responsive single page application backed by a Rails API and rendered in ReactJS. Our humble beginning starts with the budgeting spreadsheet that my family uses for our own finances. [Here is a raw template of that budget](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1JcfALRq4fZpRa92dRHcVvf24uW0dJ8jxEFhsZY6itr4/edit?usp=sharing). The project will begin by recreating the basic functionality of this spreadsheet (which has served us well for over a year), then expand on that to provide improved coverage for different budgeting needs.

Additionally, this project will be accompanied by the Habitual Wealth Blog, where I, and others, will share our personal thoughts on Biblical personal finance. Please note, I am not an accountant, nor am I exceedingly wealthy (yet). I am a student of observation and continuously seeking to learn though. Follow any advice found on this site at your own risk and under your own judgement.
